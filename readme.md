The aim is to create a clear and interactive visualization of the cerial production of the farmhouse so that it is possible read the hectares, the production, and the productivity index at a glance.
## The visualization
The visualization is mainly divided into two parts which show the same data in different ways. The first part allows you to view hectares, production and productivity (production per hectare) of all the years according to the variety selected with the drop-down menu.
